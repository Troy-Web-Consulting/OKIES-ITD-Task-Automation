## Flow of script 
- Go in incognito

- open instance with saved user data 
- start to fill out a form 
- get through form as quick as possible and pause at payment 
- opportunity to go back and fill certain things out 

## Plan
- parse through ryan files, and get familiar 
see if you can store form fill out and just populate
- operator assertions 



- make doucmentation on how to install and run the script
