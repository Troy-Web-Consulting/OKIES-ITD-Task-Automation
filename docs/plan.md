## Flow of script 
- Go in incognito

- open instance with saved user data 
- start to fill out a form 
- get through form as quick as possible and pause at payment 
- opportunity to go back and fill certain things out 


## Requirements
- must pull login info, so can setup from a certain account

## Future additions 
- clean up files with functions and such 
- randomizing, yes/no selections
- make 47 a const

## Learned 
  - auth is the more intuitive way to store vs my-user-data
  - USE PLAYWRIGHT INSPECTOR TO FIND ELEMENTS 
  - role based finding is much easier than tabbing 
  - will auto scroll when searching for elements by their CSS 
  - recorder lays a good base, but be cautious about it ad ID may be difficult 


## Storing login 
  - if internal, do it yourself, if external, will automate



## New Goals 
  - save multiple Login functionality to a branch, for further development 
  - get something out that is bare bones, put OKIES login at the Top and takes you to payment 
    - in order to do so, account for organizations 
    - also make a note of allowing permissions in certain machines 
    - and different NPM format
    - update documentation 
    - note the permutation in documentation 
    - add in alerts in actual browser 
    - in docs note when something failed 
    - note that opens up a chrome instance with none of your pluggings 
  - logic to say stop here when running it with an argument 

  - Try to get something running that works within the current instance of chrome 
    - so that anthony can have his browser extensions

  - See what I can do with multiple log-in things
  - log when each section has been completed
  

After get this out, work on conventions and model it off of the plugging repo =
Plugging is a good example for conventions in the future 
look into playwright recorder, will write as you go
