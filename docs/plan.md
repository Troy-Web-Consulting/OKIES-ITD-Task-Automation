## Flow of script 
- Go in incognito

- open instance with saved user data 
- start to fill out a form 
- get through form as quick as possible and pause at payment 
- opportunity to go back and fill certain things out 


## Requirements
- must pull login info, so can setup from a certain account

## Future additions 
- clean up files with functions and such 
- randomizing, yes/no selections

## Learned 
  - auth is the more intuitive way to store vs my-user-data
  - USE PLAYWRIGHT INSPECTOR TO FIND ELEMENTS 
  - role based finding is much easier than tabbing 
  - will auto scroll when searching for elements by their CSS 

## Storing login 
  - if internal, do it yourself, if external, will automate

## Plan
- parse through ryan files, and get familiar 

- make doucmentation on how to install and run the script
